# Metéchō

[Metéchō](https://metecho.herokuapp.com/projects) is a Salesforce.org, Open Source Commons, Web-based tool that makes it easier for you to view, test, and contribute to Salesforce Projects created for the Salesforce platform without requiring knowledge  of [GitHub](https://lab.github.com/) or [Salesforce Command Line](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli).

Pronunciation: “Met” rhymes with “bet.” “Echo” as in the reflection of sound waves.

***Definition: To share or participate in.***

##  Why is Metéchō used

Metéchō combines all the power of the GitHub code repository and Salesforce scratch orgs and wraps it into a Web site. There is no need to install anything on your computer to get something from code into a working Salesforce scratch org. Metéchō makes it easy to:

- Takes Salesforce code and metadata that has been configured with [CumulusCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) and builds an org with other package dependencies, data, and org configurations. All with the click of a button.

- Create Epics from GitHub issues. An epic is like a story of something you need to build into a project

- Assign developers and testers to bite sized tasks within an epic for declarative changes made in scratch orgs

- Automatically creates Github branches for epic task

- Automatically creates GitHub branches for tasks

- Retrieves declarative, clicks-not-code, changes from Metéchō scratch orgs to GitHub code

- Regulate access to Metéchō through GitHub

## Installation and Setup

There is no need to install anything (other than a Web browser) to use Metéchō. All that is needed is access give through the Open Source Commons.

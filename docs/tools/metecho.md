# Metéchō

[Metéchō](https://metecho.herokuapp.com/projects) is a Salesforce.org, Open Source Commons, Web-based tool that makes it easier for you to view, test, and contribute to Salesforce Projects that live in the Salesforce platform without learning [GitHub](https://lab.github.com/) or [Salesforce Command Line](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli).

Pronunciation: “Met” rhymes with “bet.” “Echo” as in the reflection of sound waves.

***Definition: To share or participate in.***

##  Why is Metéchō used

Metéchō combines all the power of the GitHub code repositorie and Salesforce scratch orgs and wraps it into a Web site. No need to install anything on your computer to get something from code into a working Salesforce scratch org. Metecho makes it easy to:

- Takes Salesforce code and metadata that has been configured with [CumulusCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) and builds an org with other package dependencies, data, and org configurations.

- Create Epics from GitHub issues

- Assign developers and testers to epic task for declaritive changes made in scratch orgs

- Automatically creates branches for epic task

- Automatically creates GitHub branches

- Retrieves declaritive, clicks-not-code changes from Metéchō scratch orgs 
to GitHub code

- Regualate access to metecho through GitHub

# CumulusCI

CumulusCI helps development teams build great applications on the Salesforce platform by automating org setup, testing, and deployment.

##  Why Use This Tool
* Cumulus CI (CCI) allows our teams to create new scratch orgs for building, testing, and training. CCI automates the workflow of deploying source code and dependencies into a scratch org or sandbox. 
* CCI is a command line tool, so it runs within a Terminal window.


## Installation and Setup
Follow this [Trail](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/build-applications-with-cumulusci) to install Cumulus CI. These instructions are easier to follow on a Mac than a PC. If you're having trouble, reach out for help when you join a sprint or OSC project.

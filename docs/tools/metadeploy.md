# MetaDEPLOY

Think of MetaDEPLOY as the Open Source Common App Exchange for installing our applications. Where MetaDEPLOY goes beyond the Salesforce App Exchange is its ability to help you configure your Salesforce org to optimally run our installed projects with any pre or post installation needs.

It should be noted that MetaDEPLOY is an [open source project of it's own](https://install.salesforce.org/products#open-source-commons) and can be used by anyone.

##  Why Use This Tool

- We like to keep company with all the other OSC apps
- A way to surface up needs outside of the OSC projects that need to be meant for smooth operation in a Salesforce org

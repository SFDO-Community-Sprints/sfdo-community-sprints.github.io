# Markdown

Markdown is a simple markup language that formats text for Web viewing. You can quickly create headings, bulleted lists, links, embedded images and much more. It is the standard for creating documentation in GitHub and GitHub Pages. Once you start using it you will notice markdown used all over the internet as a way to format text. This page was created using markdown.

##  Why Use This Tool

Since code-based solutions like GitHub are not full text editing software suites markdown becomes an important way to organize text and make things look pretty. It also has the advantage of looking organized just on its own (not converted to HTML text). 

## Installation and Setup
Markdown, by its nature is text based. You do not any additional software (other than a text editor) to use markdown. All markdown files have a file name that ends in a .md. This lets markdown views know the file required markdown HTML viewing in place. 

## Going Deeper

There are many useful resources on how to use markdown. Check out [the markdown.orgs guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) for more information. [A page on syntax is particularly useful](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Here is a quick example of what markdown looks like:

```
# Creates a heading level 1 (one per page please)

Paragraph happens naturally on clicking return

## Creates a heading level 2

[Links look like this](https://www.google.com)

```

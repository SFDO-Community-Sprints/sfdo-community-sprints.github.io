## WOW, Sydney - you did it!
We were thrilled to gather our Nonprofit and Education community virtually for one day of brainstorming, creating impactful solutions, and fun networking to build community solutions for common challenges affecting Nonprofits and Schools. After the second in-person Community Sprint [last February](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/2024-02-29-03-01-Sprint/), we knew it was time to come back for more!

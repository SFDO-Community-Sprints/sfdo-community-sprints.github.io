## ANZ Community - Thank you for joining us at the Sprint!

‚ÄúI loved being part of a wider much broader network that spans the globe. Knowing there are like-minded people out there with the same thirst for knowledge is fab.‚Äù - Sydney 2025 Sprinter

We were thrilled to gather our Nonprofit focused community together at the beautiful Sydney Salesforce Tower for a day of challenge identification, discussion, and fun networking to build community solutions for common challenges affecting Nonprofits and Schools. After the second in-person Community Sprint [last February](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/2024-02-29-03-01-Sprint/), we were excited to host you for a third time - the first event in our 10th Anniversary year - to help you move your ideas forward. A whopping seven projects were worked on - read on to discover which challenges were prioritised by this group.

### Connecting  From Across ANZ - And Beyond!

A remarkable 66 attendees joined us in person, representing a diverse array of Nonprofits, schools, Partners, and employees from Sydney and surrounding regions, including Australia, New Zealand, and India. Thank you to everyone who joined and dedicated precious time away from their daily responsibilities, your commitment to sharing your skills made this event truly exceptional. Thank you for making our collective effort such a success. 

### A special welcome from Nonprofit Leadership 

[Cori O‚ÄôBrien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coriobrienpaluck/) (Director, Nonprofit & Commons Community) kicked off the Sprint alongside [Andrew Hill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewrhill/) (Area Vice President - APAC, Salesforce for Nonprofits) who gave a warm welcome to all. Sprinters were also welcomed by Senior Director, Nonprofit Products [Kelli Hudson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelliandersonhudson/) who gave a sneak peek at the upcoming product roadmap, and joined the local team for our first-ever Nonprofit Meet the Makers session at a Sprint. 

### Meet the Makers: Nonprofit Cloud

Kelli, [Jason Hincks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonhincks/) (Industry Solutions & Strategy Director, Nonprofit), and [Hayley Morris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayley-morris-64ab99100/) (Platform Architect at Salesforce) came together over lunch for a Nonprofit ‚ÄúMeet the Makers'' session to connect with the community, share updates on product roadmap (including the much anticipated Volunteer solution!) and answer burning Agentforce questions. Short answer - yes! You can use Agentforce even if you're not yet ready to move from the NPSP to the NPC product. üëè

This live Q&A was an opportunity to engage directly with Nonprofit Salesforce leadership at the Sprint, to address your questions and get real-time answers - and it was very well received! One respondent of our anonymous survey said, ‚ÄúKeep inviting those makers behind the products!‚Äù We will!

#### 1. AnonymiseMe

Service providers in Australia are expected to support anonymous care requests, and this means service providers must provide documentation for grants as proof of their work. To build data while being compliant with anonymous requests for funding purposes, this team set out to define a Salesforce solution that captures interactions and respects the caller's anonymity request.

Work performed at this sprint:

* The team developed a process for how to sensitively capture information on anonymous enquiries to a service.

Next steps:

* Continue to meet as a team in Slack, and virtually, to in order to publish a completed recipe document with the community at large via the Commons Github pages process. 

#### 2. Credential Check (previously Working with Children‚Äôs Checks)

Continuing the work of a team at the February 2024 Sprint, this team expanded the original goal of managing security and information checks for multiple people and matching qualifications to roles.

Work performed at this sprint:

* Review of Feb 2024 Sydney Sprint, including a very detailed process map done in the Lucid Chart.
* Discussion to expand the scope of the project beyond working with Children, to fit broader use cases and general credential checks, including a credential verification process with data points for credential management.
* Built out data model and permission set structure. 

Next steps?

* Build Lightning Pages and Flows.
* Continue to meet as a team in Slack, and virtually, to finish the proof-of-concept build.

#### 3. Deep Segmentation

Storing and reporting on contact segmentation for campaigns is challenging for many Admins, and this team sought to clarify what options are readily available to help, what comes out-of-the-box today, and what other options could be considered.

Work performed at this sprint:

* Team discussion to understand attribution and segmentation models, various strategy‚Äôs and use cases, persona‚Äôs, challenges, and multi-channel campaign management. 
* Realizing everyone does it differently and there is no one size fits all solution, the team researched out-of-the-box solutions including Datacloud, Nonprofit Cloud, and current limitations of the NPSP.

Next steps?

* Continue to discuss as a community team, and collect feedback from those not in attendance at the event, perhaps with a survey.
* Review what solutions are on the market today. 

#### 4. NPSP to NPC Migration Guide Review

In 2024, Salesforce employees delivered a migration guide from the NPSP to the new NPC to assist consultant partners taking on this work. This guide is new, and could use the support of the Community as similar NPSP guides and documentation have benefited from the work of various volunteers over the years. This team set out to review the guide, and provide feedback to Salesforce employees managing the current iteration. 

Work performed at this sprint:

* Reviewed existing migration resources, looking for gaps and areas to focus on, to determine best practices for migration.

What are your next steps?

* Continue to discuss as a community team, and connect with the Nonprofit Cloud Best Practices Commons team to discuss this effort as a new work stream.

#### 5. User Guide Documentation

This project aims to develop a structured Salesforce guide designed for users who help other users. It will provide clear instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting steps, enabling individuals to support their peers effectively. The guide will serve as a go-to resource for answering common questions, improving user adoption, and reducing reliance on external support.

Work performed at this sprint:

* The team have started a User Guide Documentation. They have brainstormed out some goals, key resources, and topics/sections.

Next steps

*  They will assign different sections to team members so they can work on their sections.

#### 6. Visualization - Analytics

To make the lives of Admins easier, this team set out to help surface ways to improve visualization and data analytics using tools readily available or out-of-the-box. Rather than addressing every complexity, they choose to focus on a targeted solution: visualizing KPIs directly in Salesforce reports.
<img src="../images/Visualization&analyticsTeam.jpg" width="100%" alt="Teams hard at work at the Sydney Australia, February 27th 2025.">

Work performed at this sprint:

* After group discussion on data visualization, the team recognized the full scope of analytics is an expansive challenge but standard Salesforce reporting provides extensive capabilities that may resolve the needs of many organizations. 
* By recognizing the power of row-level formulas, they were able to create concise, at-a-glance comparison of performance versus goals, ensuring stakeholders receive clear, actionable insights without the need for additional custom fields or complex integrations.
* Explored what‚Äôs possible to achieve using AI tools.

What are your next steps?

* Continue to meet as a team to explore product limits & capabilities.

#### 7. Data & Privacy Act

In an effort to manage consent properly within the framework of the Privacy Act, this team set out to define a best practice to properly track when consent was given and explicitly what for, ie. channel, lists or programs, specific email or phone.

Work performed at this sprint:

* Explored the CommSubscription objects available and after considering multiple object complexities decided to consider a custom object proof-of-concept to track phone and email consent.
* Developed a custom object to capture and track required consent fields that has a master-detail relationship with the Contact, and fields including Source, Channel, Communication Type (ie. list or program), Subscription status, Optin-Datetime, Opt-out Datetime, Opt-out Reason and specific email/phone value. 
* Created an action on the Contact record to help users quickly create a consent record if obtained, for example over the phone. 
* Added the Consent object as a related list on the Contact layout page so we could see all the consents related to a particular Contact record. 

Next steps?

* Create a record triggered flow when a contact is created or updated via an integration or web form where explicit consent is given for further communications.
* Include direct mail subscription examples, and determine how consent information can drive marketing list selection.

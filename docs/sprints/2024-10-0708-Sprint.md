## Wrapping Up the 2nd Commons Affordable Housing Sprint in Newcastle!

We were thrilled to gather in Newcastle for our second-ever Commons Affordable Housing Sprint for two days of brainstorming, creating impactful solutions with a dedicated focus on Affordable Housing.

Earlier this year, we announced the Commons Affordable Housing Program, in which the Nonprofit Community Team and the UK Housing Team at Salesforce partnered to address the longstanding need for collaboration on technology solutions among UK social housing associations.

This special community has articulated the longstanding need for collaboration on technology solutions among UK social housing associations so the grounds were set for bringing this community together to innovate collectively.

## Bringing together Housing Associations across the UK

A remarkable 61 attendees joined us in person, representing an array of folks working within the Social Housing and Salesforce ecosystems, including End Users, Administrators, Developers, Architects, etc from Housing Associations and Industry Partners from the UK and surrounding regions. A group of housing associations gathered together like this earlier this year in March (see the overview from the March sprint!) with the specific intention to come together to innovate and create open-source solutions together.

Thank you to everyone who joined and dedicated precious time away from their daily responsibilities. Your commitment to sharing your skills made this event truly exceptional. Thank you for making our collective effort such a success.

After a fantastic networking breakfast, Cori O’Brien (Director, Commons Community) kicked off the Sprint, sharing her immense gratitude for the work the community is doing to support each other in the region and spend time at the Sprint. Alongside Cori, we had Thomas Lancefield (Housing Lead EMEA) and Etienne De Klerk (Housing Solutions Team) extend a warm welcome to everyone, emphasising the significance of the group and the need to unite Housing Associations in developing shared solutions. 

Overall, the energy in the room was buzzing and folks were eager to get started identifying challenges and getting their hands on building solutions. Let’s get into what was worked on during the next two days...

### **1. NEW: AI for Complaints.**

Some complaint records can have hundreds of data points which can be very time-consuming and difficult for a colleague to summarise. This results in a large amount of time spent on admin. Sometimes, the data captured initially is not in a suitable format for presenting back to customers. Using AI, this group plans to professionalise and standardise responses.

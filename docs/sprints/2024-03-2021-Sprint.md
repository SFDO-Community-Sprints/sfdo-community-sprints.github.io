## Wrapping Up the Inaugural Commons Affordable Housing Sprint in Newcastle 

#### Dates: March 20-21, 2024
#### Location: Newcastle upon Tyne, UK

##### “The excitement no longer revolves around the technology itself; rather, the possibilities of what can be achieved when we collaborate around a common toolset, with a shared objective to overcome the challenges faced by the sector.” - Affordable Housing Sprinter


## Wrapping up the inaugural Commons Affordable Housing Sprint

We were thrilled to gather in Newcastle for our *first-ever* Commons Affordable Housing Sprint for two days of brainstorming, creating impactful solutions with a dedicated focus on Affordable Housing.

This was also a particularly exciting week as we announced the [Commons Affordable Housing Program](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lizzyroberts_sfdocommons-affordablehousing-activity-7175872626584686593-3P5a?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), in which the Commons Community Team and the UK Housing Team at Salesforce partnered to address the longstanding need for collaboration on technology solutions among UK social housing associations.

This special community has articulated the longstanding need for collaboration on technology solutions among UK social housing associations so the grounds were set for bringing this community together to innovate collectively.

## Bringing together Housing Associations across the UK

A remarkable 77 attendees joined us in person, representing an array of folks working within the Social Housing and Salesforce ecosystems, including End Users, Administrators, Developers, Architects, etc from Housing Associations and Industry Partners from the UK and surrounding regions. This group has gathered before, but never like this - with the specific intention to come together to innovate and create open-source solutions together.

Thank you to everyone who joined and dedicated precious time away from their daily responsibilities, your commitment to sharing your skills made this event truly exceptional. Thank you for making our collective effort such a success.

We also received a hearty welcome from our incredible hosts at Home Group, Simon Parker and Tom Hill - who generously provided their incredible space for the event. We are immensely grateful for their hospitality.

Overall, the energy in the room was buzzing and folks were eager to get started identifying challenges and getting their hands on building solutions.

## Nonprofit Cloud Overview

We were also grateful to have [Jaclene Roshan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacleneroshan/), (Senior Director, Product Management, Nonprofit Cloud), who gave an overview of what’s inside the new Nonprofit Cloud and shared key feature sets that can support Housing, such as program and outcome management, case management and sales and service excellence.

This overview of what existing components can be leveraged to accelerate housing association solutions was the perfect segway into the rest of the day... which was getting hands-on to start identifying key challenges and focusing on which solutions to work on over the next few days.

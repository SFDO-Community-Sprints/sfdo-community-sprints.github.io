## Pre-Sprint "Day 0" Training
While the main event was the two day Sprint - the festivities actually kicked off even earlier - we hosted a half-day optional training, the “Day 0”.

## Huge thanks to Daniel Lim for an incredible deep dive into the future of AI!
As Senior Director of Salesforce Futures, Daniel brought exactly the forward-thinking perspective our training workshop participants needed. His exploration of the agentic wave of AI - from capabilities and organizational transformation to emerging customer behaviors - perfectly set the stage for our hands-on Agentforce builds. Daniel's insights on the Agentic Maturity Model, the shift toward autonomic cores, and how AI agents will reshape work helped our nonprofit community understand not just what's possible today, but what's coming next. Thank you for helping us think strategically about our AI journey, Daniel!

## 5. NEW: Automate the Case Notes Processing within the Participant Management Agent (aka “Truffle Hogs”)
The "Truffle Hogs" team formed to tackle the critical challenge of extracting actionable insights from case management notes. As case managers, they recognized that valuable "nuggets" or "truffles" of important information often get buried within lengthy interaction notes, making it difficult to identify next steps and track participant progress effectively. Their mission was to create an automated system that could dig through case notes to find these actionable insights and process them into structured, reportable data.

The team's approach focused on automating the extraction of key themes from case notes while maintaining human oversight and administrative control over the process. They designed their solution around three core components: an AI agent for text analysis, flow automation for processing, and a custom data model for storing actionable insights.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Developed a custom data model with objects to capture and categorize "truffles" (actionable insights) extracted from case notes.
* Built an AI agent that analyzes case notes to identify themes, patterns, and actionable items requiring follow-up.
* Created flow automation to process identified "truffles" into structured tasks and records for service providers.
* Implemented a "gated" approach to minimize over-consumption of AI credits while maintaining system efficiency.
* Designed audit trails and reporting capabilities to track extracted insights and their outcomes.


Next Steps:
* Continue development and testing of the automated case notes processing system.
* Refine the AI prompts and flow logic based on real-world case note examples.
* Complete documentation and prepare solution for broader community use via their GitHub repository.

Team members: Sean Finerty, Hayley Tuller, Austin Marshall, Masen Knight, Derick Hutchinson, Miriam Bernstein, Greg Frauenheim, and Bhanudas Tanaka.

## 6. NEW: Extend the Participant Management Notes within the Participant Management Agent (aka “Truffle Makers”)
The Truffle Makers formed to tackle critical nonprofit operational challenges: simplifying permission set configuration, improving referral data tracking, and maximizing case manager meeting notes. The team recognized that case managers generate valuable insights through client interactions, but this knowledge often remains trapped in individual notes. By developing AI solutions to extract trends and actionable insights from case management documentation, The Truffle Makers aimed to help nonprofits transform routine administrative data into strategic intelligence for better service delivery.

The name reflects their mission to uncover hidden gems of valuable insights buried within everyday operations - like finding precious truffles!

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Created two custom objects: Keywords (with description and active status fields) and Keyword Assignments (joining Keywords to Interaction Summary records).
* Built reports for tracking keywords and keyword assignments to enable auditability and standard reporting.
* Developed Agent Actions including keyword analysis prompts that review interaction summaries and recommend appropriate keyword assignments.
* Created testing assets with sample keyword records and interaction summaries for demonstration purposes.
* Built flows to support caseworker verification and accuracy checking of AI-generated keyword recommendations.


Next Steps:
* Continue developing additional prompts for trend analysis over time ranges and identification of untracked keywords that should be monitored.
* Expand agent capabilities to recommend programs based on identified interest tags and keywords.
* Enhance reporting capabilities to show trends across different groups, time periods, and program contexts.

Team Members: Ben Mozenter, Gordon Lee, Meg Gray, Alexa Honsberger, Ali Ayub, Jay Mehta, and Alisha Glenn.

## 7. NEW: Grantee Progress Report Agent
The Grantee Progress Report Agent addresses a critical challenge in nonprofit grantmaking: enabling grant managers to effectively evaluate the impact and effectiveness of awarded funds. Many grant managers struggle with manually analyzing progress reports and comparing submitted data against intended outcomes, making it difficult to assess whether funding is achieving its goals. The team developed an AI solution that automates the intake and analysis of grantee submissions, creating intelligent summaries that compare actual progress against stated intended outcomes, helping grant managers make data-driven decisions about ongoing and future funding.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Built modular manual flow triggers with Agentforce prompts to accommodate various licensing levels and credit monitoring needs.
* Created Requirement Summarization flow that gathers all Funding Award Requirement Sections and associated files to generate comprehensive summaries.
* Developed Funding Award Summarization that consolidates all requirement summaries into overall award progress reports.
* Implemented comparison functionality that evaluates submitted progress against intended outcomes for grant effectiveness analysis.


Next Steps:
* Optimize prompts to enhance summary quality and accuracy.
* Refine flows to prevent failures across all scenarios and edge cases.
* Conduct testing with real grantee data and large file volumes to ensure scalability.
* Monitor and optimize credit usage for cost-effective implementation.
* Enhance integration with Outcomes data model for deeper impact analysis.
* Expand comparison capabilities against program goals and organizational mission.

Team Members: Caroline Hoyt, Josh Hoobler, Nate Rusch, Brent Shively, Jasneet Malik, Mira Greene

## 8. Nonprofit Salesforce How-To Videos
This project focuses on creating accessible educational content to help nonprofit organizations better understand and utilize Salesforce. The team originally set out to develop video-based tutorials but evolved their approach during the sprint to explore more interactive and personalized learning solutions that could provide real-time guidance to users.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Tested a variety of large language models (LLMs) to generate scripts for educational content.
* Identified and developed a use case for creating an interactive chatbot to guide Salesforce users through report creation processes.
* Discovered that chatbot-based guidance could be more effective than traditional video tutorials for complex tasks.
* Explored the potential for creating personalized, conversational learning experiences.

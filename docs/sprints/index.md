# Ideate. Create. Share. Learn more about Community Sprints

Community Sprint Events are about coming together to collaborate with organizations like yours to build solutions to address everyday challenges. By attending a Sprint, you'll come together in person, virtually, and via Slack to work on projects that are important to you and will make a real difference for Nonprofits and Schools using Salesforce technologies.

When you attend a Sprint event, expect to spend your time working alongside other Salesforce.org community volunteers (Customers, Partners, and Employees) on specifc goals prioritized by the community. Over 90% of participants say they learned new skills by participating!

We regularly host two-day **Community Sprint** events, either in-person or virtually about 3 times per year (since 2015!), where up to 150 Sprinters work on a variety of projects at the same time. We also host **Mini-Sprint** events, which are smaller one-day virtual events where 10 - 30 Sprinters focus their time on one specific project.

# Who participates at Community Sprint Events?
Anyone can join in the fun - you don't need to be a developer! In general, we encourage all those that work within the Salesforce ecosystem (Customers, Partners, and Employees) who have an interest in helping build technology solutions to make using Salesforce easier for Nonprofits and Schools. This means you'll be rolling up your sleeves wtih other Admins, Developers, End Users, Consultants, and Salesforce Employees.

## Can I still attend if I know nothing about writing code or using Github?

Absolutely! Bringing an idea to life takes much more than just a skilled developer and there are so many ways to contribute to a Community Sprint that has nothing to do with writing code. The beauty of a Community Sprint is that we all come together to work toward the same goal. You can help define use cases and best practices or help to simplify hard-to-grasp concepts. You can share your organization's story and how you use the products. You can write new or improve an existing product or best practice documentation, write or edit scripts for upcoming NPSP videos, or even help test a new tool. Your level of coding or configuration experience is not a barrier!

# What will I work on at the event?

Itâ€™s up to you! At the Sprint, you will be given an opportunity to work with an existing project team, as well as identify current challenges faced by the Nonprofit and Education community and prioritize those that you think the community should swarm around to find a solution. 
When deciding what project to work on at the event, you can choose to contribute your skills to a new project spun up from this activity, or to an established project team that is continuing to work on solutions for pre-determined challenges. Over 90% of participants say they learned new skills by participating!

# What support is given to new Sprinters?

A LOT! Generally, we welcome approx. 50% new Sprinters each time we host an event, so we're very experienced in making sure everyone who attends feels like they can contribute and understands what to expect whether it's an in-person or virtually hosted event. 

Some examples of what you can expect to participate in are:
- Event Slack channel to promote pre-sprint conversation, info shares, and fun
- A Know-Before-You-Go pre-event webinar
- Sprint Buddy program to match you up with an experienced Sprinter
- Detailed FAQ and other support materials
- Suggested ways to ready your computer and create an appropriate Salesforce environment for testing, taking screenshots, etc.

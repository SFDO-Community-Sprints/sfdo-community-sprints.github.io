# What's an Open Source Community Sprint?

*It's all about our amazing community!* It goes way beyond the Power of Us Hub. 
During the event, the community of admins, implementation partners, app partners, 
and developers will come together with a common goal of making the ecosystem around 
our open source products better for everyone else (lots of laughs and caffeine included too).

The goal of the Community Sprint is simple: making the most of *your* contribution. 
Create something impactful that can be shared with everyone in some capacity. 
It's an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) format style event. 
What exactly that contribution is depends on who is attending and what skills they bring. 

# What to expect during a sprint/mini sprint
* Pair programming or heads-down writing mixed with occasional big picture brainstorming
* Breakout rooms on top of breakout rooms
* Learning how to use GitHub and helping each other get unstuck
* Take breaks (ok to join a work call if needed)
* (Virtual only): We encourage you to keep video on (if you are comfortable doing so)
* Sense of accomplishment for making Pull Requests (PRs) against Issues !!!

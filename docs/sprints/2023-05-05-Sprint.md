If this is your first time encountering our events, Sprints are Salesforce hosted community innovation events that are regularly hosted to bring nonprofit & education organizations, partners, and employee volunteers together to identify, prioritize and build solutions that make using Salesforce more impactful.

We Sprinted with a packed room of 78 Nonprofit and Education Customers, Partners, and Salesforce employee volunteers at the NYC Salesforce tower Friday, May 5th. For 71% of our attendees, this was their first time coming together in a space like this to collaborate and build solutions for their nonprofits and schools, so you can imagine the first-time jitters many felt entering the room. The social breakfast provided networking opportunities, a chance for those who’d signed up to get a welcome buddy to meet up for the first time, and big hugs for those that hadn’t seen each other in literally years. 

We received a warm welcome filled with gratitude from Salesforce Executive Vice President of Global Nonprofits Michael Wolff, and of a surprise welcome from our trusted Community Mascot Sprinty. Our events are so inclusive, even a T-Rex can contribute his skills!

Feedback is still rolling in, but we heard that “after the size of world tour it was nice to connect in a smaller scale with folks”, that “being surrounded by people who could speak the same technical language was uniquely refreshing”, and “it was so energizing to collaborate and actually create outcomes that will benefit the collective good”.

## What was worked on throughout the Sprint?
Sprinters worked on seven different projects making a huge amount of progress in just 1 day. Here’s the full recap of who attended, what was worked on, and what you can expect to see at the next Sprint!

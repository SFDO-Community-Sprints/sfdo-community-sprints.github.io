# World Tour London Community Sprint
### Date: June 30th, 2023
### Location: London, UK



## Looking for the World Tour London Sprint Wrap-Up? It’s coming soon! 

In the meantime, if you're local to the London area or traveling in for the Salesforce World Tour join us at the next Community Sprint on Friday, June 30th to contribute your skills-building solutions to help Nonprofits and Schools use Salesforce more effectively (and have fun!).

This will be our second time this year bringing the Salesforce.org Community Sprint to London (by popular demand), so if you couldn’t make it in [January](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/2023-Jan-1718/) now’s your chance. The Sprint is a free event; all are welcome - you don't have to be registered for World Tour London to join us.

## Event Overview

[Image Gallery]() TBD

The Community Sprint attended by 94 in-person and virtual Sprinters, was a first of its kind event for the Commons Community. It embraced a truly hybrid model; that is, it facilitated real-time participation from every attendee, rather than just adding a digital component to an in-person event.

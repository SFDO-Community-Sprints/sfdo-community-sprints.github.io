The Community Sprint attended by 94 in-person and virtual Sprinters, was a first of its kind event for the Commons Community. It embraced a truly hybrid model; that is, it facilitated real-time participation from every attendee, rather than just adding a digital component to an in-person event.

# Project Team Report Backs
Scroll down to see which projects participated in the Sprint, what they worked on and what are the next steps for future volunteers. 

## App Advice & Consumer Reports
This is a legacy Community sourced list of commonly used Salesforce Apps by the Salesforce.org community that needed a revamp! The [App Advice and Consumer Reports](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kHigSAE?tab=discussion&sort=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE_DESC) group in the Trailblazer Community (formerly from the Power of Us Hub) is 100% community created and maintained.
#### What was worked on?
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/App-Advice) for more info.
- Kicked off the project revamp with an audit. Each team member chose a topic and opened the can of worms that is very out-of-date research.
- Updated Trailblazer Community; Migrated Google Sheet #1 to Quip for easier sharing outside Salesforce.
#### Next Steps
- Keep the project going at upcoming Sprint events, and continue posting and collaborating in the Trailblazer Community. This is a very important activity for the community and we'd really love to see this topic being included in the agenda for every sprint!

## Common Data Models
Project spun up at our Dreamforce event in September 2022 to focus on how the community can use the power of the Salesforce platform to provide consistency for data models that are commonly implemented in the Nonprofit and Education spaces to avoid duplicate work and promote collaboration and best practices. Admins often solve the same use cases over and over again.  But, not always with best procedures and scalability in mind.  What if there were a library of common use cases built on NPSP available for Admins to review, learn from, model their work based on, or install and customize?  That's what Common Data Modules do!
#### What was worked on?
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Common-Data-Models) for more info.
- Defined the Purpose & Intended Use, and Identified a Proof of Concepts.
- Landed on creating an example CDM focusing on 'applications' functionality.  Began building out GitHub. Brainstormed strategies for building greater interest and participation in CDM efforts
#### Next Steps
- Establish Development Procedures to Build our Proof of Concept & Build ERD.
- Meet Monthly, Build Resources, Build a Proof of Concept, Advocate and Build Awareness.

## DEI Framework
The [DEI Framework project](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DEI-Framework) is focused on increasing the diversity, equality and inclusion in the Community Sprint ecosystem.

- We had such a rich deep conversation with lots of great fresh perspective from our new Sprinters! Thank you to everyone who joined our project today: Akash, Winni, Michela, Avash, Erika, and Charise.
#### Next Steps
- Finalize report. We have a task list in our DEI slack channel.
- Delve more into outreach efforts as well as the design/marketing of the report.

## FlowRecipes

#### What was worked on?

# Looking for the Virtual Community Sprint Overview? It’s coming soon! 

In the meantime, Registration for the next In-person Commons Community Sprint in Sydney is LIVE. [Register NOW](https://invite.salesforce.com/commonscommunitysprint-aadf)! 

On 29 February & 1 March, as part of #SalesforceTour Sydney 2024, join us for two days full of networking, fun, and building Salesforce solutions to help Nonprofits and Schools address common challenges. We had a blast at the [first Sydney Sprint event in November](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/2023-11-1516-Sprint/#down-under-community-innovation-wrapping-up-the-first-ever-commons-community-sprint-in-sydney-australia), and we’re excited to be coming back to host you again.

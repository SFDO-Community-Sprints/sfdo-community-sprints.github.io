## **WOW, what a MASSIVE start to 2024!**

We were thrilled to gather our Nonprofit and Education community virtually for two days of brainstorming, creating impactful solutions, and fun networking to build community solutions for common challenges affecting Nonprofits and Schools. The anticipation for this virtual sprint was palpable, with registrations reaching full capacity weeks before the event. To accommodate the overwhelming interest, we collaborated closely with project team leaders, pulling in additional contributors from the waitlist.

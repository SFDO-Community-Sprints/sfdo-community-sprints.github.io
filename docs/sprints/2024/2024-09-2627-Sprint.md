### Location: Virtual, Global


***"Salesforce Open Source Community Sprints are incredible opportunities to learn, share expertise, network, build impactful solutions, and contribute to innovations for nonprofits and educational institutions! Trailblazers around our world pour a lot of heart, talent, and time into making a difference together!" - Virtual Sprinter***


## WOW, another truly global virtual sprint!

We were thrilled to gather our Nonprofit and Education community virtually for two days of brainstorming, creating impactful solutions, and fun networking to build community solutions for common challenges affecting Nonprofits and Schools. For this virtual sprint, we experimented with different start times to accommodate participants outside of the United States. We weren’t sure how this would go, but the feedback was overwhelmingly positive and appreciative of our efforts to include folks from around the world. We will likely continue experimenting in the future, but we’re glad this approach worked out!

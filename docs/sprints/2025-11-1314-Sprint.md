# Wrapping up the Denver 2025 Sprint!

WOW, DENVER! It was so great to be back hosting our first Community Sprint in Denver since 2018! Truly the whole week we kept saying, "great vibes" ... you all showed up and really threw yourself into this experience, so for that, we are so grateful! 

67 attendees joined us in person for the 2-day Sprint, representing the Nonprofit and Education ecosystems - including end users, admins, developers, architects, and industry partners from across Denver and beyond.

To everyone who joined: thank you for carving out time during what we know is an already busy time of year. Your willingness to share your skills, insights, and energy made this event truly exceptional. We’re so grateful for your time and passion.

75% of the room were NEW sprinters (!) - and our returning leaders rose to the occasion beautifully, mentoring newcomers and creating the collaborative, welcoming atmosphere that defines our community. The combination of fresh energy from new faces and generous guidance from experienced sprinters made for an incredibly productive and inspiring two days.

With the welcome remarks setting an inspiring tone, it was time to dive into the heart of what makes these sprints special - the collaborative project work.

## Let’s Sprint!

After breakfast and intros, it was time to get to work. Attendees had the option to join 4 existing projects and formed 4 brand-new projects on the spot. Collaboration kicked off quickly, with creative energy flowing.

## 4. Nonprofit Cloud Best Practices - Assessments & Grantmaking (sub-groups)
Similar to early community-led efforts to help nonprofits find success using the NPSP, the goal of this project is to begin gathering ideas and feedback to see what the Nonprofit Cloud (NPC) best practices could look like and where the community could concentrate their efforts. Led by Toby Ward, Tara Cobb, Maria Kelley

The NPC Best Practices project is divided into a number of focused subgroups; two subgroups participated in this Sprint: Assessments and Grantmaking. The subgroups concentrated on developing comprehensive documentation, implementation guides, and strategic considerations to help nonprofit organizations effectively leverage these critical Salesforce solutions for their mission-driven work. Below is a summary of the subgroup's progress.

Work performed at this sprint:

1) Assessments Sub-group
Accomplishments:
* Analyzed and documented the differences between the Discovery Framework, Public Sector Assessments, and Form Framework, creating a detailed comparison table of capabilities and considerations for each option
* Developed a comprehensive list of use cases for assessments and drafted thorough documentation for setting up Discovery Framework Assessments, including creating a data import template for questions and providing detailed instructions on the permissions required to expose assessments in Public Experience Cloud sites
* Continued testing and documentation efforts
* Gathered additional resources

Next Steps:
* Validate documentation by reviewing and replicating setup steps in a test environment, making edits for accuracy as needed
* Expand documentation to include considerations and recipes for scoring assessments, as well as best practices for reporting on assessment data and results
* Finalize documentation at the Virtual Sprint in January 2026

2) Grantmaking Sub-group
Accomplishments:
* Reviewed current functionality to identify what's working and what needs improvement in the Grantmaking solution
* Developed a phased approach to grantmaking considerations, mapping out Phase 0 through Phase 3 from "Who is your organization" to "Due Diligence." Each phase outlines high-level steps and use cases designed to inform grantmakers about available functionality and configurations that support best practices throughout the grantmaking lifecycle
* Finished brainstorming use cases
* Created questionnaire to help organizations document their funding processes
* Started presentation deck to help organizations translate their work into NPC grantmaking use cases

Next Steps:
* Continue brainstorming additional phases and develop a landing page featuring key considerations for Grantmaking implementations
* Detail potential use cases, permission considerations, and reporting considerations for each phase
* Complete presentation deck at January Virtual Sprint
* Begin writing comprehensive use case documentation to guide organizations through successful Grantmaking deployments

## 5. Page Layout vs. LRPs with Dynamic Forms
The Page Layout Considerations team addressed the critical need for clearer documentation around the differences between page layouts, Lightning Record Pages, and dynamic forms. They focused on helping admins understand when and why to convert between these different approaches and how to make effective edits within each system.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Identified insufficient documentation explaining what changes occur when converting from page layouts to Lightning Record Pages and dynamic forms
* Worked on understanding decision-making criteria for when conversion makes sense versus when admins should stick with their current setup
* Focused on clarifying where and how to make edits within each system to help admins navigate these different approaches more effectively
* Developed comprehensive documentation for publication
* Created table of considerations for page layout decisions
* Built decision tree to guide page layout implementation choices

Next Steps:
* Publish comprehensive documentation that explains the differences between page layouts, Lightning Record Pages, and dynamic forms
* Include guidance on conversion decisions and best practices for making edits within each system
* Share resources with the community via the [detailed document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14u936yz_7QKQbdr3zX5x6z1w3_qdQJQ2ZXUoRpGYFaA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.xlpf7pbcpfx1) and [live webpage](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/Commons%20Solutions/launched/page-layout-considerations/).

## 6. Report and Report Type Audits
The Report and Report Type Audits team wanted to address solving critical visibility gaps for Salesforce administrators by building comprehensive Report and Report Type audit capabilities. In the hopes of sharing a set of work-around instructions, the team spent time trying to understand why private reports and Report Types cannot be reported upon or called at the same time.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Recognized challenges admins face when managing reports and report types, particularly around understanding dependencies before making changes
* Noted that default report types automatically include all fields from objects, creating messy configurations
* Identified that changes to custom report types can break existing reports without proper visibility into usage patterns
* Identified that the ReportTypeApiName field exists in only one Salesforce org and isn't documented
* Tested multiple technical approaches to access private report data: SOQL with AllPrivate scope permissions, Apex describe methods on reports, reports/Dashboards API calls, Elements Cloud reporting capabilities, Metadata API/Org Browser in VS Code
* Documented technical limitations preventing access to private reports across all tested methods
* Escalated critical findings to Salesforce internal research team for investigation
* Developed workaround process requiring Modify All Data permissions and individual user login approach

Next Steps:
* Develop solutions that provide admins with clear visibility into report dependencies
* Show how many reports use each report type and which specific reports would be affected by changes
* Enable safer field deprecation and report type modifications while maintaining user experience
* Await response from Salesforce internal research team on ReportTypeApiName field availability
* Explore alternative technical solutions based on Salesforce guidance
* Continue building audit capabilities once private report access method is resolved
* Refine workaround approach if needed for large-scale org implementation

## 7. Salesforce Indicators
With Salesforce Indicators, you can visually highlight important data at a glance, making it easy to focus on what matters most. This Custom Metadata driven Lightning Web Component is all about making key details pop, and giving you lightning-quick insights at a glance on your Salesforce records. Led by Tim Schug.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Completed project orientation and established use cases for 4 core areas: Child/Grandchild Data indicators, Clickability behaviors, Grid view composite indicators, and Header components
* Team delivered functional Clickability 1.0 with URL navigation and merge variables; refactored and merged 2 years of Builder LWC development work; created wrapper LWC for Digital Experience site compatibility
* Designed "Summary Indicator" concept with bundle-based satisfaction tracking and drafted UI mockups
* Secured Spanish and Bulgarian translation support from community volunteers

Next Steps:
* Expand Clickability functionality based on sprint code review
* Develop technical strategy for Bundle Summary/Tree-Grid Summary LWC implementation
* Continue building out Custom Metadata driven Lightning Web Component functionality

## 8. Unsubscribe Link
Send an email to anyone from inside Salesforce and include an unsubscribe link right in the email! This app will find all contacts and leads with that email address and mark them “Email opt out” and create an Unsubscribe (custom object) record to track unsubscribes over time. Led by Aaron Crosman.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Identified and tracked bug in setup batch jobs with corresponding PR to resolve
* Updated installation documentation and incorporated important edits
* Drafted new App Exchange text with additional images

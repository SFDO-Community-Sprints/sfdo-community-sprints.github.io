### Dates: 17 June, 2025

### Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands

## Wrapping Up the FIRST EVER Nonprofit Community Day, which took place in Amsterdam, NL!

After an inspiring week in London - [check out the recap](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/2025-06-09-Sprint/) - [Cori O’Brien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coriobrienpaluck/) (Director, Nonprofit Community) headed to Amsterdam to continue connecting with our community but this time within the Netherlands.

_“It was my first time at a nonprofit community event and now I regret not attending any in the past 7 years!”_

On 17 June, we hosted our first-ever Nonprofit Community Day - and what a day it was! Held at Salesforce’s brand-new Amsterdam office, the event brought together 42 nonprofit professionals, executives, partners, and Salesforce teams for a full day of learning, sharing, and community building. And although we lost about 20 additional participants due to a last minute Train Strike that covered the whole of the Netherlands, it was a fantastic turnout for our first event in the region.

### What We Did
We kicked off the morning with networking over breakfast, followed by a shared agenda focused on innovation, impact, and the future of nonprofit technology. We intentionally engaged Nonprofits and partners from all roles, which led to fantastic conversations on how Salesforce technology is helping scale charitable organizations across the Netherlands.

_“Everyone in the room built a working agent within an hour - what an achievement!”_

### Highlights included:

* A Nonprofit Cloud “Meet the Makers” session, led by [Lori Freeman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loridfreeman24/) with product roadmap, insights, and a Q&A with support from industry experts [Sophie Van Poele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophievanpoele/) and [Redouan Cherkaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/redouancherkaoui/).
* An afternoon hands-on Admin Track featuring deep dives on Data Cloud, Common Components, and Agentforce—led by [Cori O’Brien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coriobrienpaluck/), [Sophie Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-green-61160566/), and [Redouan Cherkaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/redouancherkaoui/). We also showed participants a taste of what Community Sprinting is like with an interactive solutioning workshop to consider common technology challenges and how Community volunteers might work together to solve them.
* An afternoon Executive Track tackling big ideas like the Agentic Era and Breaking Through Barriers—led by [Pierre-Marie Boutet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmboutet/).

Throughout the day, guests explored live demos, exchanged ideas with peers, and connected with leaders from across the ecosystem.

There’s incredible momentum building in the nonprofit tech space across Europe. This event confirmed just how essential it is to create space for both visionary thinking and practical enablement, and we hope to scale this first-ever pilot event to other regions across the globe.

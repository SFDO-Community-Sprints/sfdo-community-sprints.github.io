# Commons + Community + Connection = The real magic of Dreamforce
### Date: September 11th - 13th, 2023
### Location: San Francisco, CA

Wow, we can truly say this was the BEST Dreamforce events we've experienced yet! We may say that fairly often, but this one felt extra special  - we hope you had a fantstic time if you could make it. The Commons team was onsite engaging in an incredible FOUR community focused events and hands-on activations, not including Sprinty’s special guest appearance as part of the main Nonprofit Keynote witnessed by the 900+ standing-room only crowd. If you’ve been a part of the Salesforce Nonprofit and Education community (even briefly) you know connection is the true magical ingredient, and we saw it in spades. We engaged directly with over 120 participants across all four events, of which half were completely new to the Commons. Incredible! 

Read on for details on how the Commons Community showed up at Dreamforce, especially if you coudln't be there with us in person.

Our DF23 Highlights:

* Sprinty’s surprise appearance with [Mike Wolff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwolff1/) - Executive Vice President, Nonprofits at the **Nonprofit Keynote** on Tuesday was truly a hit! [Check it out here](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/dreamforce_2023/series/nonprofit_&_education_at_dreamforce_2023/episode/episode-s1e1) on Salesforce+ starting at min 51:44 if you missed it. 
* We hosted two small-group conversations (Braindates) and a large Roundtable hands-on innovation session to talk about how anyone can “**Volunteer Your Skills to Solve Nonprofit Tech Challenges**”. Each session showcased ways to get involved in the Commons program either at upcoming events or directly with existing projects. Huge thank you to MVP [Chris Pifer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chpifer/) (Attain Partners), and MVP [Dar Veverka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darveverka/) (Idealist Consulting) for joining as co-hosts at the Roundtable. 
* **Commons Community Lunch & Show-n-Tell:** And last but not least, our flagship event at DF23. This year, we leaned into one of the best parts of Sprinting and created space for our Nonprofit and Education community to come together, refuel, and network while learning a bit more about Commons solutions that can be used today via ten Community volunteer-led demos on current Commons projects. 
    * **10 Community Project demo’s** - watch this space for demo recordings from the lunch, and an opportunity to join a “Commons Show-N-Tell DF2U” Webinar series in October to engage and watch community project leaders demo their solutions LIVE in October. 
    * Feedback we’re hearing: *“****The Commons Community is an incredible group of Trailblazers****—new members and long-time sprinters alike—who generously give their time, hearts, and talents to helping organizations and each other be more successful together on the greatest platform for change!!”* - Lunch Participant 
    * Not only did we have Customers, Partners, and Salesforce Staff take time out of their busy Dreamforce schedules to attend, but we are grateful to have hosted our very own [**Travis Fabian**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/travisfabian/) - Senior Vice President of Global Nonprofit Solutions, and [**Chase Schults**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaseschults/) - Senior Director Architecture, Cloud Specialization & Commons Community, at the event to welcome participants and to show their support for the Commons. Travis shared *“****The Commons community is magic.*** *In my career at Salesforce, being part of a community makes solving tough problems a lot easier, but also a lot more fun. Thank you to all of the community members for the impact you're making every day in the sector."*

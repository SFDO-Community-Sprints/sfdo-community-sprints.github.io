## Bringing together the Nonprofit & Education Community

A remarkable 79 attendees joined us in person over the 2-day Sprint, representing the Nonprofit, Housing, Education, and Salesforce ecosystems, including End Users, Administrators, Developers, Architects, etc from customer and Industry Partners from London and surrounding regions. 

## A special showing from our inaugural Commons Affordable Housing Sprint 

Earlier this year we announced the [Commons Affordable Housing Program](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lizzyroberts_sfdocommons-affordablehousing-activity-7175872626584686593-3P5a?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), in which the Commons Community Team, UK Housing Team at Salesforce, and the Housing Industry Advisory Council partnered to address the longstanding need for collaboration on technology solutions among UK social housing associations. 

The first Affordable Housing Sprint occurred in [Newcastle in March](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/2024-03-2021-Sprint/), and while this week’s Sprint wasn’t exclusive to Housing, a number of our housing community participants joined us in London to continue projects started in Newcastle - in fact, 3 out of the 7 projects at this sprint were Housing-focused which showcases the commitment to building open source affordable housing solutions. 

**Thank you to everyone who joined** and dedicated precious time away from their daily responsibilities, your commitment to sharing your skills made this event truly exceptional. Thank you for making our collective effort such a success.

## A special welcome from Ivar Jansen

After a fantastic networking breakfast, [Cori O’Brien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coriobrienpaluck/) (Director, Commons Community) kicked off the Sprint, sharing her immense gratitude for the work the community is doing to support each other in the region and spend time at the Sprint. Alongside Cori, we had [Ivar Jansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivarjansen/) (VSr. Area Vice President, Head of Sales, EMEA) who extended a warm welcome to everyone, emphasising the significance of the group and the need to unite among the wider community to develop shared solutions. Ivar also highlighted the importance of the Nonprofit community and addressed the sheer breadth and depth of our footprint across the wider Salesforce ecosystem.

Overall, the energy in the room was buzzing and folks were eager to get their hands on building solutions.

Leadership from seven existing projects were eager to get going, highlighting important jobs-to-be-done, and to engage with new volunteers.

In a Community Sprint first, all three Housing-focused projects merged to join forces to tackle a common challenge faced by many - a lack of “self-serve” options for Housing Members. The Self-Serve, Repairs, and Complaints teams combined to create an Experience cloud portal resolving all three needs. We’ve detailed the individual work streams below, and going forward teams will work alongside each other on their journey to sharing what they’ve built into the community.

* Created a help guide for setting up a profile for the portal. Built out on the documentation.

**Next steps:**

* Maintain momentum and continue with semi-regular meetings and check-ins to build on the documentation.
* Continue collaboration with housing project teams to embed their work within the manual.



### 6. Housing Repairs Journey

**This group focused on identifying pain points and lack of relevant communication within the repair journey for Affordable Housing.**

**Work performed at the sprint:**

* Built a basic flow for repair logging and diagnosing in a developer Org. Drafted a plan to guide design/requirements gathering to support the implementation of the flow and Field Service so each Housing Association can bespoke to their own data requirements, policies, processes, and procedures.
* Aligned with the other Housing projects to integrate into a single portal. 


**Next steps**

* Complete the requirements/design plan to guide implementation of the flow, including adding in the communications templates that we created at the Sprint.

**This group focused on using Salesforce to build an end-to-end complaint management system, including delivering to the ombudsman.**

**Work performed at the sprint:**

* Mapped out a support process for Housing Complaint case management. 
* Linked Salesforce functionality to the SLAs for Ombudsman. Fields and page layout created. Process mapped.

## A post Sprint bus ride!  

After the Sprint wrapped up, we boarded a double-decker bus, and headed over to the ‘night before World Tour’ Nonprofit Reception... it was the MOST epic way to end the Sprint and get everyone ready for World Tour the following day.

## The Nonprofit Community Showed up in Full Force at World Tour London!

Following the two-day sprint, the Commons team kept the Community momentum going by hosting a Networking Breakfast on the morning of World Tour London (6 June) that welcomed almost 200 (!) attendees. We had an executive welcome from [Ivar Jansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivarjansen/) (VSr. Area Vice President, Head of Sales, EMEA), Cori and Lizzy addressed the Commons program and ongoing ways to stay engaged with the community, and finally we wrapped with a special address from [Amir Kabel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirkabel/) (VP, International Equality).

There were hands-on sessions, roundtables, and Nonprofit-specific content for our community as well. The AI for Nonprofit sessions had queues around the corner - tons of interest and excitement from our community, great showing overall!

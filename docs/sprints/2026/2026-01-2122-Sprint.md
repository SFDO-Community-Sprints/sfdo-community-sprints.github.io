_I really loved the Nonprofit Sprint - it was my first time, and everyone was incredibly welcoming and supportive. I learned about many new and inspiring tools, and what stood out most was the strong sense of collaboration, with people truly helping each other and sharing knowledge. It was a great community experience!_ - Virtual Sprinter


# WOW, another truly global virtual Sprint!
We were thrilled to gather our Nonprofit and Education community virtually for two days of brainstorming, creating impactful solutions, and fun networking to build community solutions for common challenges affecting Nonprofits and Schools.

## Our Global Reach: Connecting Across Continents
A remarkable 154 attendees joined us virtually, representing a diverse group of Nonprofits, schools, Partners, and employees from across the globe. From Australia to Canada, to Germany and the United Arab Emirates, the enthusiasm and commitment were truly global, with participants hailing from 19 different countries!

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who made this global collaboration possible. To those who burned the midnight oil, rose with the sun, and dedicated precious time away from their daily responsibilities and loved ones, your commitment to sharing your skills made this event truly exceptional. Thank you for making our collective effort a resounding success.

## Nonprofit Roadmap Q&A

Thank you to Lori Freeman, Kelli Hudson, and the Nonprofit Product Team who joined us at the start of the Virtual Sprint to share about your team, your focus for the year, the upcoming product roadmap, and answered questions during our Q&A! Our community always asks for updates about what's coming with the product, so it was great to get these updates from your team right before everyone dove into projects, helping to level set on what Salesforce's plan is for the year.

## Let’s Sprint!

After morning introductions and the Nonprofit Roadmap Q&A, it was time to get to work.

## 1. Agentforce Nonprofit Best Practices (AFNBP)*

_Recently renamed their group from Nonprofit Cloud Best Practices to the Agentforce Nonprofit Best Practices group to align with the recent changes to the Nonprofit Cloud product name._

Similar to early community-led efforts to help nonprofits find success using the NPSP, the goal of this project is to begin gathering ideas and feedback to see what the Agentforce Nonprofit Best Practices could look like and where the community could concentrate their efforts. There were 3 sub-groups for this project: Reporting, Grantmaking and DocGen.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Reporting: Selected Program Reports as their next reporting project, began compiling a comprehensive list of needed reports for nonprofits using AFNP, completed review and draft notes for NPSP Program Management Module report list, and planned out workflow for next group meetings.
* Grantmaking: Started mapping PowerPoint slides for AFNP grantmaking, created an outline for populating those slides with key grantmaking considerations, published the Grantmaking Considerations page, and started on a slide deck to help map programs and funding opportunities.
* DocGen: Defined the project scope, established their jobs to be done, completed several initial tasks, compiled a DocGen Data Dictionary for the objects needed for the DAF Acknowledgement, and worked on getting the DAF Acknowledgement Letter working in a scratch org including the data mapper.

Next Steps:
* Reporting: The Program and Case Management subgroup will continue its hiatus to focus on getting these reports out; the reporting group will then move on to Grantmaking and the PCM group will resume its work with Case Management use cases.
* Grantmaking: Complete the mapping slide deck to help outline functionality orgs need for funding opportunities to help translate to AFNBP functionalities; bi-weekly meetings to continue the work.
* DocGen: Finalize and document the process along with prerequisites for setup.

## 2. AI for Nonprofits: A project seeking to help Nonprofits benefit from generative AI tools and Agenforce.
This team is working to create a helpful guide of prompts to make using AI tools like ChatGPT and Agentforce easier for Nonprofits.

Work performed at this sprint:
The team split into two subgroups to tackle different AI use cases for nonprofits.
* Donor Snapshot Group: Set up a sandbox environment, connected it to Slack, designed the output structure for a Donor Snapshot Record to help nonprofits quickly understand donor relationships, and began building out the Sprinty Super Snapshot agent (encountered some blockers during testing on the first topic).
* Case Triage & Response Drafting Agent Group: Identified the challenge of nonprofits receiving high volumes of cases (assistance requests, volunteer questions, event inquiries), explored solutions using flows to trigger agents, created a planning document and defined specific objectives, spun up a dev org, and built a draft agent to classify cases based on Subject and Description using ChatGPT-generated prompts with a flex action (this version provides recommendations for support reps to review rather than automatically assigning case types).

Next steps:
* Donor Snapshot Group: Continue testing and building the agent, create additional topics, complete Salesforce-side testing, then test in Slack.
* Case Triage & Response Drafting Agent Group: Finalize agent functionality, migrate to the AI Nonprofits org, document build steps with modification instructions for organization-specific Case Types, and expand design to include Case Subtypes and draft responses.
* Continue working through blockers related to AI functionality in Slack and NPC licenses.

## We even had a visit from Sprinty himself!
Who is Sprinty? Meet our community mascot, T-Rex! Sure, those tiny arms make it tough to reach the keyboard, but what Sprinty lacks in wingspan, they more than make up for in enthusiasm!

Getting (dino)hands-on with our amazing Salesforce Nonprofit Community at the Virtual Sprint, building solutions that help nonprofits do more good in the world.

## **WOW, what a MASSIVE start to 2024!**

We were thrilled to gather our Nonprofit and Education community virtually for two days of brainstorming, creating impactful solutions, and fun networking to build community solutions for common challenges affecting Nonprofits and Schools. The anticipation for this virtual sprint was palpable, with registrations reaching full capacity weeks before the event. To accommodate the overwhelming interest, we collaborated closely with project team leaders, pulling in additional contributors from the waitlist. This ensured that every eager participant had the opportunity to be part of this epic experience!

### **1. AI Prompt Recipe Book for Nonprofits:** **A project seeking to help Nonprofits benefit from crafting effective prompts in generative AI tools.**

This team is working to create a helpful guide of prompts to make using AI tools like ChatGPT easier for Nonprofits. At the last Sprint, they gathered survey responses from other Sprinters, capturing ideas for where to focus on prompt recipes, developed and tested prompt examples, and will continue to work on compiling a published list to share in the Community.

Work performed at this sprint:

* Formulated some personas for prompt testing, and began submitting prompts to ChatGPT (3.5 and 4.0) and Google Bard. Prompts submitted into Salesforce via Screen Flow and Experience Cloud.
* Across the two days, we ran 71 tests across 23 prompts.
* Prompts have been logged into Salesforce.
* The first draft of the AI Prompts Recipe Book is well underway.
* Draft of AI Prompts for Nonprofits Best Practices doc is also underway.


Next steps:

* Continue testing prompts, compile best practices document, and compile examples prompt recipe book if possible.
* Ratify drafts of Google Docs and get ready to upload to Sprinty's Community Resources.
* Meet with the group soon and set up a cadence to build continued momentum for the project.

# What a Week! London Sprint & Nonprofit Community at World Tour

_Disclaimer: This recap contains excessive American enthusiasm. Words like “awesome,” “amazing,” “buzzing,” “wow,” and “remarkable” may appear without warning. UK audiences beware ;) p.s. yes, this is a joke... well, kind of!..._

WOW — did this week go down in the history books as the busiest week for Salesforce in London EVER?! Maybe! With the first-ever TDX London taking place alongside World Tour London on 11–12 June, we thought, why not add a Community Sprint into the mix? 

So, to kick things off for the week, we gathered on Monday, 9 June at Salesforce’s Blue Fin Tower (in the newly launched UK AI Centre!) for a day of brainstorming, building, and connecting in support of the Nonprofit, Housing, and Education communities.

## Bringing Together the Nonprofit, Housing, & Education Community 
A remarkable 73 attendees joined us in person for the 1-day Sprint, representing the Nonprofit, Housing, Education, and Salesforce ecosystems — including end users, admins, developers, architects, and industry partners from across London and beyond.
To everyone who joined: thank you for carving out time during what we know is an extraordinarily busy couple of weeks. Your willingness to share your skills, insights, and energy made this event truly exceptional. We’re so grateful for your time and passion.

## A Special Welcome from Salesforce Leadership 
After a buzzing networking breakfast, *Cori O’Brien* (Director, Commons Community) officially kicked off the day, sharing deep gratitude for the strength and dedication of this regional community.

We were also joined by *Evan Paul* (Senior Director, Impact & Sustainability), who summed up the vibe perfectly when he said, “I’ve found my people!” It was a reminder that this is a special group—coming together with purpose, heart, and shared vision.

Later, *Kavindra Patel* (VP, Trailblazer Events) welcomed attendees with reflections on the significance of this moment: the very first TDX London. While he acknowledged that we’re still ironing out the details, he emphasized that 2025 marks a global expansion—TDX is no longer exclusive to San Francisco, but now also hosted in Tokyo, Bengaluru, and London. This is a new chapter—and your feedback and presence are shaping the future.

## Meet the Makers: Lunchtime with Nonprofit Cloud 
Over lunch, we were thrilled to host a Nonprofit Cloud “Meet the Makers” session featuring Elizabeth Swander, Sophie Green, and Meg Grey—a rare chance to connect directly with members of the Nonprofit Cloud product team.

Attendees got a behind-the-scenes look at what the team is currently working on, learned how product decisions are shaped (yes, they really do read your IdeaExchange submissions!), and had time for open Q&A.

One attendee shared that her team had recently submitted an idea on the IdeaExchange, and to their surprise, it’s already been implemented! Huge kudos to Liz, Meg, and the entire team for not just listening, but acting quickly on community feedback. This is exactly why we host sessions like this.
Now, let’s dive right in to share more about what projects were worked on!

## Let’s Sprint!

After breakfast and intros, it was time to get to work. Attendees joined existing projects or formed three brand-new ones on the spot. Collaboration kicked off quickly, with creative energy flowing.

After a quick round of project descriptions, folks moved around the room and signed on to the groups they felt most drawn to. Collaboration was officially underway - and the creative energy was palpable.

# Check out the 7 Community-Led projects that participated:

## 1. Technical Collective
Originally launched at the Salesforce Commons Sprint in January 2023, this initiative helps upskill junior admins while connecting nonprofits with experienced technical support, all powered by community collaboration. They welcomed a whopping 30 volunteers to contribute at the Sprint, which allowed them to tackle a number of important jobs-to-be-done.

Work performed at this sprint:
* *Website + Branding:* Created a full website structure, migrated content, wrote FAQs, updated the [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-technical-collective/posts/?feedView=all) with a new logo, and officially launched a functioning site! [View the work-in-progress site!](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/The-Technical-Collective/)
* *Onboarding + Offboarding:* Improved onboarding journeys for Junior Salesforce Professionals (JSPs), Technical Coaches, and Nonprofits with updated process maps, email templates, offboarding questions, and a project summary template for LinkedIn profiles.
* *Training Videos:* Planned, scripted, and recorded an impressive 134 (!) onboarding videos to support new community members across roles. These will be compiled into one video which will be shared in the future.
* *Forms + Automation:* Installed and configured PDF Butler/Form Butler, set up lead processes and fields, began building sign-up forms, and implemented email automation to notify participants throughout the project lifecycle.

Next steps:
* Add KPIs to the website, build out the forms fully, implement automation for new mentors and JSPs, and continue refining the Salesforce org to support end-to-end processes.

## 2. DLRS (Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries)
DLRS allows users to roll up data from child records to parent records using Lookup Relationships or IDs - a powerful, code-free tool to help admins manage data more effectively.

Work performed at this sprint:
* *Marketing & Visibility:* Began updates to the AppExchange listing, created new imagery, drafted a how-to video script, and secured a domain to improve access to DLRS documentation.
* *Documentation Updates:* Started revising and improving the upgrade documentation to make it easier for users to implement the latest versions.

Next steps:
* Continue refining the documentation and complete the updated AppExchange listing to improve discoverability and adoption.

## 3. Nonprofit How-To Video Series
This project aims to create a series of accessible, easy-to-follow how-to videos for the nonprofit community, helping users better understand and implement Salesforce for Nonprofit products and other tools.

Work performed at this sprint:
* *Script Testing & Review:* Used a ChatGPT-based template (from the March 2023 Sprint) to generate scripts for [UnofficialSF](https://unofficialsf.com/) components. Of the three reviewed, one script is now ready for final review and recording, while the other two revealed limitations in the generated instructions.
* *LLM Experimentation:* Testing an LLM capable of analyzing Salesforce metadata to generate more accurate, contextual instructions, an effort to improve upon the sometimes sparse and inconsistent documentation on UnofficialSF.
* *DLRS Collaboration:* Worked with the DLRS team to identify five video topics. The team provided a script for one video and will take ownership of writing the remaining four.

Next steps:
* Refine the LLM tool and create an improved template that incorporates more contextual resources to enhance future video scripts.

## 4. Housing Complaints
This project began at a housing-specific Sprint in early 2024 and focuses on using Salesforce to build an end-to-end complaint management system.

Work performed at this sprint:
* *Email Templates for Each Stage:* Developed three tailored templates for key stages in the complaint lifecycle—Acknowledgement (Stage 1), Response (Stage 2), and Final Resolution—as well as a follow-up survey email to capture resident feedback post-resolution.
* *Complaint Case Page Layouts:* Page layouts were configured for each stage of the Complaint Case object, with context-specific fields, action plans, and visibility rules to guide case handlers through the correct process for Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3.
* *Holiday-Aware Flow Automation:* A smart Flow was built to integrate with the UK Government’s public holiday API—automatically adjusting milestone due dates that fall on weekends or holidays to ensure SLA compliance and reduce manual intervention.
* *Milestones & Entitlements Setup:* The Milestones and Entitlements framework was configured so each complaint case links to the appropriate process (e.g., Stage 1 vs. Stage 2), with timers tracking key SLA deadlines in full alignment with the 2024 Complaint Handling Code.

Next steps:
* Check in one month to review milestone progress and begin planning AI integration and dashboard development.

## 5. NEW: AI Documentation
Inspired by a presentation at [London’s Calling,](https://www.londonscalling.net/) this new project explores how to make AI-powered org documentation tools more accessible and useful for nonprofit admins, particularly those in low-resourced environments.

Work performed at this sprint:
* *Project Framing & Discovery:* The group focused on defining the project’s scope by asking key questions: What is the unmet need this tool can address? Who are we building this for? What gaps exist in current resources or tooling? What are the barriers for nonprofit teams in using tools like SFDX Hardis? How can we deliver something that’s immediately helpful—ideally something lightweight, like a wizard—for admins?
* *Tool Exploration:* Evaluated how tools like SFDX Hardis could be adapted or simplified for nonprofits to better document their Salesforce orgs in an admin-friendly way.
MVP Planning: Discussed realistic outcomes for a first iteration and aligned on focusing on an MVP that could be validated between now and the next Sprint.
​​
Next steps:
* Validate MVP scope and define core jobs-to-be-done (via Slack/virtual collaboration)
* Get a few community members using the tool to test functionality and gather early feedback
* Solicit input from others—have you used SFDX Hardis or want to? [Check it out here](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/#as-sfdx-plugin)
* The goal is to refine this tool over time—similar to the evolution of DLRS, and make it truly useful for Salesforce orgs with limited resources.

## 6. NEW: “Flows To-Go” 
This brand-new project aims to create a centralized repository of ready-to-use Flows that admins can easily install into their orgs, offering a practical, time-saving resource for the community.

Work performed at this sprint:
* *Solution Framing:* Began defining the vision and structure for a managed package that would house a curated library of helpful Flows.
* *Drafting Guardrails:* Outlined initial best practices and guardrails to ensure consistency, usability, and security for Flows included in the repository.
* *MVP Planning:* Identified a first set of Flows to include in the MVP version and aligned on scope and next steps.

Next steps:
* Begin development of the MVP solution
* Build out Flow documentation and install guides
* Coordinate a future working session to continue progress

## 7. NEW: Data Model Mapping
This project began with a bold idea — address challenges with the NPC data model- and through constructive discussion, focused on an achievable and impactful goal: create a field mapping framework to help smaller organizations plan a migration from the Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) to Nonprofit Cloud (NPC), focusing specifically on the mapping itself.

Work performed at this sprint:
* *Field Mapping for Migration:* Developed a draft .csv mapping to translate NPSP standard (and custom) fields into NPC fundraising objects and fields. The goal is to help smaller nonprofits understand how their current data can align with the NPC structure.
* *Proof of Concept Work:*
* Created a basic Python script that takes in a mapping file and NPSP data export to generate CSVs for import into NPC
* Drafted a template mapping file for standard Opportunity fields
* Outlined an initial user guide to support future testing and feedback
* Important Note: This is not a fully developed tool—rather, it’s an early mapping prototype and concept, intended to explore feasibility and support future development.

Next steps:
* Finalize the MVP script and mapping file
* Build out a user guide for testing
* Identify a long-term home for the repository (currently housed in Google Drive / Jupyter notebook)
* This foundational work could become a valuable resource for Salesforce-light orgs looking to move from NPSP to NPC with minimal technical overhead.

## And If the Sprint (and Plushie!) Weren’t Enough…
We kept the momentum going all week long! After Monday’s Sprint (9 June) and Tuesday evening’s Nonprofit Reception (10 June), we kicked off Agentforce World Tour London bright and early on Wednesday (11 June) with a Nonprofit Community Breakfast—the perfect way to gather before the whirlwind of the day began.

It was a joy to bring our community together in a quieter moment before the whirlwind of the conference took over. We shared coffee, conversation, and community, plus a few inspiring words from across the ecosystem.

We were honored to be joined by guest speakers:
* Evan Paul from Salesforce Impact
* Christie Fidura from the Developer Community
* Mia Moore from the Slack Community
* And our incredible Kim Bradberry, RVP of Nonprofit Sales

Their presence highlighted what we’ve always known: nonprofits are a vital part of the broader Salesforce ecosystem. The morning was filled with warmth, gratitude, and connection—a powerful reminder that we’re building something bigger together.

Cori addressed the Nonprofit Community and Commons Program and ongoing ways to stay engaged with the community. Throughout the rest of the day, there were hands-on sessions, roundtables and Nonprofit-specific content for our community as well. 

# What’s Next? 
Cori actually kicked off this whole London adventure the Friday prior by attending London’s Calling, because - as we always say - this community shows up for us, so it’s important we show up for you. And the momentum doesn’t stop here.

Next up: Cori heads to Amsterdam for our FIRST EVER Nonprofit Community Day on 17 June! We can’t wait to continue the energy and collaboration there.

# What a Week! Our FIRST EVER Canadian Community Sprint!

_“The energy and spirit of community at these events always reminds me how much stronger we are when we share expertise and work together.” - Virtual Sprinter_

## Kicking off the Week with the Vancouver Nonprofit User Group

We gathered on Monday, Sept 9 at the Eatery for the Social Kick-Off with the Nonprofit User Group in Vancouver.

Major shoutout to [Clair Lam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clairlam/) and [Lynda En](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndaen/), the local user group leaders who organised this meetup to welcome our Nonprofit crew to Vancouver! And also, shoutout also to the sponsors Cascadia Cloud Solutions, Findock and of course the Trailblazer Community team for supporting the local community, creating as pace for us to come together and providing some delicious sushi in a cool, funky, local Vancouver venue.

## A Welcome from Salesforce Leadership

After a buzzing networking breakfast, [Cori O’Brien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coriobrienpaluck/) (Director, Commons Community) officially kicked off the day, sharing deep gratitude for the strength and dedication of this regional community… especially since this is our FIRST EVER Canadian Sprint!

## Lunchtime with Dar Veverka on Nonprofit Cloud Migrations

Over lunch, we were thrilled to host a Nonprofit Cloud “Brown Bag” session featuring [Dar Veverka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darveverka/) (Migration Solutions Architect and Program Manager) - this session was a chance to connect directly with members of the Nonprofit Cloud product team, specifically to discuss the hot topic of Nonprofit Cloud Migrations.

Attendees got to ask Dar any and all questions around the NPSP to NPC migration process, which included conversations around what Ideas from the IdeaExchange for NPC, and even getting to hte root of WHY someone would consider this kind of migration.

Now, let’s dive right in to share more about what projects were worked on!

## Let’s Sprint!
After breakfast and intros, it was time to get to work. Attendees joined 5 existing projects and formed 1 brand-new project on the spot. Collaboration kicked off quickly, with creative energy flowing.

The AI for Nonprofits team works to create helpful guides of prompts to make using AI tools like ChatGPT and Agentforce easier for Nonprofits. Led by Jana Walker and Katie Loescher.

Work performed at this sprint:
* AI Agent Development: Began building two AI "agents" in Salesforce—one for Donor Stewardship and another for event creation. They successfully added custom actions but encountered errors that need debugging.
* AI Tool Research & Content Creation: Researched and tested various free AI tools for nonprofit use cases and created a sample AI-generated video presentation using Lumen5.
* Documentation & Strategy: Brainstormed and documented OpenAI/Salesforce integration, including use cases, prompt best practices, risks, and cost analysis. They also began creating a "how-to" guide.
* Project Infrastructure: Set up key project management assets, including a dedicated Google Drive, a YouTube channel, and a Salesforce development environment (org and sandbox).

Next steps:
* Debug the AI Agent: Troubleshoot the errors preventing the agent from working correctly with the goal of successfully creating a campaign.
* Expand Documentation: Continue building out the "how-to" guides for the processes they are creating.
* Create Video Tutorials: Produce a step-by-step tutorial on how to create AI video content with Lumen5 and potentially record a demo of their Salesforce agent in action.

Join the [Commons Project: AI for Nonprofits](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F9KX0000009xl90AA?tab=discussion&sort=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE_DESC) group in the Trailblazer Community to ask questions or get involved.

## 2. NEW: Chartiable Receipting: A project to help nonprofits master Canadian and US tax receipting for compliance and donor trust.
The new Receipting group brings together a team of volunteer experts to create clear, accessible resources that help Canadian and US nonprofits master charitable receipting.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Created a comprehensive guide detailing the importance of receipting for legal compliance, audit readiness, and donor stewardship.
* Developed a side-by-side comparison of Canadian (CRA) and US (IRS) tax receipting requirements.
* Compiled a detailed matrix to evaluate and compare different receipting software solutions based on features, compliance, and data security.
* Clarified key compliance issues such as Canadian data residency, items that cannot be receipted, and the difference between a thank-you acknowledgment and an official tax receipt.

Next Steps:
* Create Promotional Content: Develop various materials to share the resource, including a Knowledge Article, a GitHub document, a presentation slide, and posts for LinkedIn and the Partner Community.
* Share with Key Communities: Post the guide and matrix to the Partner Community and the official "Sprinty Resources" page.
* Distribute to Influencers: Share the presentation slide with Nonprofit User Group Leaders to encourage wider adoption and awareness.

## 3. Memberships: An app to help Nonprofits track their membership data more effectively.
The Membership Essentials team is prepping to launch their upcoming package to deliver features helpful for memberships, sponsorship, renewals, payments, multiple members, families, benefits, etc., within Salesforce to help Nonprofits track their data more effectively. Led by Chris Pifer, Janina Capacillo.

Work performed at the Sprint:
* Successfully onboarded nine new team members to the sprint.
* Outlined the project work by creating eight tasks and completed the first one after resolving initial technical issues.
* Began the quality assurance process by brainstorming various test scenarios.

Next Steps:
* Continue working on all open tasks, which include:

Next Steps:
* On Friday, the team will continue development on all of the above in-progress flows.

## 5. Nonprofit Cloud Best Practices
Similar to early community-led efforts to help nonprofits find success using the NPSP, the goal of this project is to begin gathering ideas and feedback to see what the Nonprofit Cloud (NPC) best practices could look like and where the community could concentrate their efforts. Led by Dar Veverka, Tracey Braun, Junette Tan, Toby Ward, Judi Sohn, Shari Carlson.

The NPC Best Practices project is divided into several subgroups, each focusing on a key area. As a whole, the project successfully published new DPE (Data Protection and Encryption) guidance to the community repository. Below is a summary of each subgroup's progress.

Work performed at this sprint:

1) Program and Case Management

Accomplishments:
* Onboarded new team members to the sprint.
* Drafted two new use cases for program management.
* Streamlined their work by re-categorizing one use case to case management and removing another that was redundant.

Next Steps:
* Continue developing the remaining program management use cases.
* Begin working on case management use cases once the program-focused ones are complete.

2) ARC

Accomplishments:
* Brainstormed guidance documents and other resources to create for the community.
* Analyzed and discussed best practices for modeling complex households and other use cases.
* Created visual aids, including diagrams and screenshots, to support their recommendations.
* Set up a new Salesforce sandbox to facilitate their work.

Next Steps:
* Aim to complete the draft guidance document, including visuals and ARC "recipes," by the end of Friday.
* Identify potential automations that could be included in a future package.

## 6. Summit Events App (SEA): Community-built event management solution for Nonprofits and Schools
Summit Events App is an end-to-end event management solution for everyone. SEA provides customizable event management, making registration, receipts, confirmation, and reporting easier and integrated with Salesforce. Led by Thaddaeus Dahlberg, Janeen Marquardt, Pieter Kop.

Work performed at the Sprint:

* Strategic Planning: Analyzed two AI agents currently in development, defined their core "Jobs To Be Done" (JTBD), and established a clear plan for moving forward.

Next Steps:
* Resolve Blocker & Test: Address the current GitHub issue to allow for the installation of the testable app version and begin testing person accounts.
* Divide and Conquer AI Development: Split the AI team into two specialized groups:
* Group 1 (Technical): Will build the technical architecture for the "event creation" agent.
* Group 2 (Strategic): Will map the business process and define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the "registration" agent to prepare it for development in the next sprint.

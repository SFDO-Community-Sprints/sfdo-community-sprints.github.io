We were thrilled to bring our nonprofit-focused community together for the first time ever at the Salesforce McLean office! Over two days, we identified challenges, engaged in thoughtful discussions, and connected through fun networking—all with the goal of building community-driven solutions for common challenges affecting nonprofits and schools.

This marks our second event in our 10th Anniversary year—just last month, we kicked things off in [Sydney](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/2025-02-27-Sprint/)!). Six projects were worked on—read on to discover which challenges were prioritized by this group.

## Lunchtime Sessions: Extra Value For Our Sprinters! 

### Day 1: Meet the Makers – Nonprofit Cloud

Over lunch, [Elizabeth Swander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethswander/) (Senior Manager, Product Management), [Sean Finerty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-finerty/) (Manager, Product Management) and [Eric Hufford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-hufford-24aa9361/) (Industry Solutions & Strategy Director, Nonprofit) led a Nonprofit Cloud “Meet the Makers” session. Attendees connected with the community, got a sneak peek at the product roadmap (a little preview before Agentforce World Tour!), and had their burning product questions answered on topics like Agentforce, the IdeaExchange, and more.

This live Q&A was a unique opportunity to engage directly with Nonprofit Salesforce leadership, ask questions, and receive real-time answers—plus a few key takeaways! It was a fantastic discussion, packed with valuable insights and thoughtful dialogue.

## 4. Nonprofit Cloud Best Practices 

Similar to early community-led efforts that helped nonprofits succeed with NPSP, this project aims to collect ideas and feedback to shape Nonprofit Cloud (NPC) best practices. The goal is to identify key areas where the community can focus its efforts to maximize impact and adoption.

Work performed at this sprint (3 sub-groups)
* Program and Case Management: Reviewed the PMM-to-NPC comparison chart, worked on scenarios, and completed and published both the PMM mapping document and the PMM-to-NPC chart.
* Flow: Conducted bug hunting and troubleshooting. Published three new pages to inform stakeholders about the reporting committee.
* Reports: Recommended reports and analyzed the questions they address in NPSP. Defined reports in NPC and mapped them to relevant objects. Reviewed standard reports from NPSP and recommendations from NPC, compiling them into a spreadsheet of useful reports. Began de-duplicating, prioritizing, and translating them into NPC terminology.

Next Steps:
* Program and Case Management: Continue developing and refining scenarios.
* Flow: Work on additional miscellaneous items and prepare more content for publication.
* Reports: Address the requirement for structured data (e.g., implementing the "Gift Transaction Type" picklist field on the Gift Commitment object) to enable key reports. Continue reviewing, finalizing, and translating the remaining proposed reports.

## 5. Unsubscribe Link

Send an email to anyone from inside Salesforce and include an unsubscribe link right in the email! This app will find all contacts and leads with that email address and mark them “Email opt out.” It will also create an Unsubscribe (custom object) object so you can track unsubscribes over time.

Work Performed During This Sprint:
* Updated documentation, improving instructions for clarity and incorporating the latest version.
* Conducted end-user testing of the setup and fixed issues in flows to enhance the user experience.
* Developed new Visualforce emails to create a more engaging and polished email experience.
* Began creating documentation, including videos and scripts, for the AppExchange.

Next Steps:
* Finalize documentation for the transition to Flow and continue discussions on Next Steps:.
* Develop a Lightning App.
* Further improve the user experience.

## 5. NEW:  Flow Replacements for NPSP Workflows

The Flow Replacements group was formed to help nonprofits easily transition from NPSP and V4S workflow rules to Salesforce Flows.

Work performed at this sprint:
* Worked to reduce 20 workflow rules down to 8.
* Completed initial documentation for recreating all but one set of workflows (phone number-related workflow still in progress due to a complex formula affecting four different fields).

Next Steps:
* Finalize the first iteration of all new flows, complete peer reviews, and create initial end-user documentation.
* Determine whether to keep the solution as-is, package it as an unmanaged solution, or explore other implementation methods.
* Develop a strategy to increase awareness and adoption of these new flows.

# WOW, another truly global Virtual Sprint!

_“As a first time sprinter, I immediately felt ‘at home’ with everyone else joining and in my working group. It was a wonderful opportunity to learn and share knowledge, on top of a chance to connect with folks in the community doing amazing work for nonprofits.” - Virtual Sprinter_

We were thrilled to gather our Nonprofit and Education community virtually for two days of brainstorming, creating impactful solutions, and fun networking to build community solutions for common challenges affecting Nonprofits and Schools.

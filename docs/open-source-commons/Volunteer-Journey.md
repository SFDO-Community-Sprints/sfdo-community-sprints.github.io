Here is our FAQ for the Commons Community Sprints and other events. Keep reading to find our frequently asked questions to set you up for success!

# What is a Commons Community Sprint?

[Community Sprints](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/) are the meet-ups (either physically in-person or virtually) portion of the Salesforce.org Commons Program where we gather our incredibly engaged community of Customers, Partners, and Employees for 1â€“2 days of brainstorming, community activation, and driving impactful solutions to solve the world's most challenging problems. We do this by actively listening to each other, educating each other, and bringing our passion, experience, and technical know-how to projects that can be replicated and shared throughout the Salesforce ecosystem. 

Sprints are a product of the collective actions of individuals contributing their thoughts, ideas, talents, skills, and passion to their communities. Every event is different because every Sprint is composed of unique individuals. Work is driven by the collective community at the event.

# Who attends Community Sprints?

Anyone can attend! Salesforce.org is committed to hosting a diverse and inclusive event. In general, we encourage all those that work within the Salesforce ecosystem (Customers, Partners, and Employees) who have an interest in helping build technology solutions to make using Salesforce easier for Nonprofits and Schools. 

# Can I still attend if I donâ€™t know anything about writing code?

Absolutely! Bringing an idea to life takes much more than just a skilled developer and there are so many ways to contribute to a Community Sprint that has nothing to do with writing code. The beauty of a Community Sprint is that we all come together to work toward the same goal. You can help define use cases and best practices or help to simplify hard-to-grasp concepts. You can share your organization's story and how you use the products. You can write new or improve an existing product or best practice documentation, write or edit scripts for upcoming NPSP videos, or even help test a new tool. Your level of coding or configuration experience is not a barrier!

Help us make sure ALL feel invited and welcome at this event, especially those that have never been to a Sprint before. We encourage you to share this event within your network. We all want to feel included and sometimes a personal invitation makes all the difference. 

_If you have any questions about what the Sprint experience is like, please feel free to contact event organizers at sfdo-opensource@salesforce.com._

# How can I prepare for the Sprint in advance?

Past sprinters have found that they felt most successful at a Sprint when they create a working environment to play in during the Sprint, and learn more about our products.

_Note: Please DO NOT use your organizationâ€™s Production org or even a Sandbox org during the Sprint event. You need an org where you can make changes to design a new feature, take screenshots, or share your screen with other Sprinters and you donâ€™t want your processes interrupted or customer data exposed._

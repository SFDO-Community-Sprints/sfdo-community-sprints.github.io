# Cumulus CI

##  Why Use This Tool
Cumulus CI (CCI) allows our teams to create new scratch orgs for building, testing, and training. CCI automates the workflow of deploying source code and dependencies into a scratch org or sandbox. 


## Installation and Setup
Follow this [Trail](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/build-applications-with-cumulusci) to install Cumulus CI. These instructions are easier to follow on a Mac than a PC. If you're having trouble, reach out for help when you join a sprint or OSC project.

# Github
_Github is a collaboration platform for developers that offers "version control" features for staging and tracking changes to code and related documents._

##  Why Use This Tool
- Before Github, OSC kept most files in personal Google Drives.  This created access and continuity issues for projects over time!
- Now, all OSC projects have Github repositories within a common Github Organization
- Github is the industry standard for collaborating on code-based projects (apps, automation, etc)
- Github is also be useful for projects focusing on docs, marketing, community
- New volunteers can scroll through active project repo's to find a way to engage

## Installation and Setup
- To participate in Open Source Commons, you need to have a (free) account with Github.com
- We recommend using Github Desktop if you will be a frequent contributor and/or code engineer

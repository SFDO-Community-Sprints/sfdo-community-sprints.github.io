# Welcome to the [Salesforce.org Commons!](https://www.salesforce.org/resources/open-source-commons/)
_New volunteers, we're so glad you're here!_


# Some prep you can do on your own
_these will take some time and you might need some support if you are not familiar with Developer tools.  Project members are available to help you_
* Review open issues in project GitHub repositories
* First three modules of [this Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/set-up-your-workspace-and-install-developer-tools)
* All of this [trail](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/build-applications-with-cumulusci)
* If you are working on Recipes, come to the sprint with a Scratch Org or Sandbox with NPSP installed
  * Please do NOT use a Production environment during the sprint!
  * If you do not know how to create a scratch org, a great alternative for getting started is using a Trailhead playground with NPSP installed.  Follow instructions [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/projects/install-nonprofit-success-pack-into-a-trailhead-playground/install-npsp-into-a-trailhead-playground)
  * Scratch org commands
    * EDA: `cci flow run eda:trial_org --org dev --default` 
    * NPSP: `cci flow run npsp:install_prod --org dev` OR clone the recipe templates repo and then `cci flow run npsp_scratch --org dev`
    * [CCI Cheat Sheet](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat-sheet.html)

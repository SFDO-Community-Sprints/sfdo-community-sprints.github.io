  >. Open Source Commons is a community of mission-driven individuals working
  together to solve the world's most challenging problems. We do this by
  actively listening to each other, educating each other, and bringing our
  passion, experience, and technical know-how to projects that can be replicated
  and shared throughout the Salesforce ecosystem. We work to remove barriers to
  entry so that everyone can be a part of this vision. <br /><br />

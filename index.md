Sprinty the t-rex is the official community mascot of the Commons. Sprinty (Pronouns He/Him) represents inclusivity, comradery, and a can-do attitude. He has been a favorite member of the Sprinting community since 2016 when his dear friend Jace Bryan invited him to the Harvard Community Sprint to highlight that the the Commons is a place where everyone is welcome, even a T-Rex!

Since then, Sprinty continues to join in the fun at Community Sprint events, and motivate Sprinters to keep up their amazing work. Be sure to grab a hug, a coveted photo, or a high five from Sprinty at an upcoming event.

# Salesforce.org Open Source Commons & Community Sprints

## Open Source Commons Vision
Open Source Commons is a community of mission-driven individuals working together to solve the world's most challenging problems. We do this by actively listening to each other, educating each other, and bringing our passion, experience, and technical know-how to projects that can be replicated and shared throughout the Salesforce ecosystem. We work to remove barriers to entry so that everyone can be a part of this vision.

## Open Source Commons Values
### Impact
OSC exists to support your organization's mission. Impact is more than a metric; it's a measure of full bellies, warm beds, animals saved, and students graduated. We increase impact by empowering teams of individuals to create solutions that serve a larger community and scale to improve the lives of hundreds or thousands.

### Innovation
We believe in technological innovation as a multiplier. OSC reduces inefficiencies, duplication of effort, and barriers to sharing. This allows teams to collaborate and develop scalable and repeatable solutions for the Salesforce platform.

### Inclusivity
OSC welcomes all contributions. Every voice is crucial, and no contribution is too small. Solutions are most effective when informed by diversity and inclusivity. Great ideas come from unexpected or quiet voices, and from questioning certainty and expertise.

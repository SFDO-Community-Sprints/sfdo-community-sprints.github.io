# Welcome to the Open Source Commons! 
The Commons program provides a platform for our community to address technology challenges in the Nonprofit and Education sectors through open source Salesforce innovation, but it’s so much more than that. Through Community Sprint events, like hack-a-thons, and other engagement spaces like Slack, our Nonprofit community defines challenges and builds open-source solutions to share with each other. For almost 20 years, Nonprofit Trailblazers just like you have contributed their Salesforce and professional skills to help solve common challenges, so that others could see more success with the power of Salesforce. Today, the Commons Community team continues that legacy, and drives impact through mentorship and learning opportunities.

## Get Involved at a Community Sprint
What’s a [Community Sprint](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/)? Sprints are Salesforce-hosted community innovation events (similar to a hack-a-thon) that are regularly hosted around the world to bring partners, customers, and employee volunteers together to identify, prioritize and build solutions and resources that make using Salesforce more impactful for nonprofit & education organisations.

Why should I join? Sprints are unlike anything else in the Salesforce community. You are encouraged to use your Salesforce and professional skills to collaborate and build nonprofit + education community-led apps, resources, and solutions. Not to mention they are a super fun way to connect with other local Salesforce users, admins, and developers!

Celebrate 10-year's of Sprinting in 2025! There’s never been a more exciting time to engage to build community-led resources, apps, and solutions on top of the world’s #1 CRM. Find an [upcoming event](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/) and join us today!

Sprinty the T-Rex is the official community mascot of the Commons. Sprinty (pronouns He/Him) represents inclusivity, comradery, and a can-do attitude. He has been a favorite member of the Sprinting community since 2016 when his dear friend Jace Bryan invited him to the Harvard Community Sprint to highlight that the the Commons is a place where everyone is welcome, even a T-Rex!

Since then, Sprinty continues to join in the fun at Community Sprint events, and motivate Sprinters to keep up their amazing work. Be sure to grab a hug, a coveted photo, or a high five from Sprinty at an upcoming event.

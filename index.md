# Welcome to the Open Source Commons! 
The Commons program provides a platform for our community to address technology challenges in the Nonprofit and Education sectors through open source Salesforce innovation, but it’s so much more than that. Through Community Sprint events, like hack-a-thons, and other engagement spaces like Slack, our Nonprofit community defines challenges and builds open-source solutions to share with each other. For almost 20 years, Nonprofit Trailblazers just like you have contributed their Salesforce and professional skills to help solve common challenges, so that others could see more success with the power of Salesforce. Today, the Commons Community team continues that legacy, and drives impact through mentorship and learning opportunities.

## Get Involved at a Community Sprint
What’s a [Community Sprint](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/)? Originally starting in America in 2015, Community Sprints are the meet-ups (either in-person or virtually) portion of the Salesforce Commons Program, where we gather our engaged community of Customers, Partners, and Salesforce employees for 1-2 days of challenge discussion, solution brainstorming, and getting hands-on to build impactful Salesforce solutions to solve common day to day technology challenges that affect Nonprofit organizations and Schools. We do this by actively listening to each other, educating each other, and bringing our passion, Salesforce and professional experience, and technical know-how to projects that can be dreamed up, built by the community (you!), and then shared as open source solutions throughout the Salesforce ecosystem.

Why should I join? Sprints are unlike anything else in the Salesforce community. You are encouraged to use your Salesforce and professional skills to collaborate and build nonprofit + education community-led apps, resources, and solutions. Not to mention they are a super fun way to connect with other local Salesforce users, admins, and developers!

Who attends Community Sprints? Can I still attend if I don’t know anything about writing code?

Absolutely! Bringing an idea to life takes much more than just a skilled developer and there are so many ways to contribute to a Community Sprint that has nothing to do with writing code. The beauty of a Community Sprint is that we all come together to work toward the same goal. You can help define use cases and best practices or help to simplify hard-to-grasp concepts. You can share your organization's story and how you use the products. You can write new or improve an existing product or best practice documentation, write or edit scripts for upcoming NPSP videos, or even help test a new tool. Your level of coding or configuration experience is not a barrier!

Can I still attend if I don't know anything about Salesforce products?
Anyone can attend a Sprint (and we encourage you to invite your friends and colleagues), but we highly recommend that you have at least some level of hands-on experience as a Salesforce End-User with a few Trailhead badges under your belt, or Administrator, or Developer, or Architect, or other Salesforce product related experience. Sprints are more like a hack-a-thon than a hands-on-training, learning day, or webinar. The Commons Community team is committed to hosting a diverse and inclusive event and we find that those who have at least a baseline of experience and knowledge in Salesforce Nonprofit and Education products have the most impactful time at a Sprint. In general, we encourage all those who work within the Salesforce ecosystem (Customers, Partners, and Employees) who have an interest in helping build technology solutions to make using Salesforce easier for Nonprofits and Schools to register to attend. If your current experience level does not match the recommendations above, we encourage you to join your local Salesforce User Group where you can learn and network with local Admins and experts instead.

Sprinty the T-Rex is the official community mascot of the Commons. Sprinty (pronouns He/Him) represents inclusivity, comradery, and a can-do attitude. He has been a favorite member of the Sprinting community since 2016 when his dear friend Jace Bryan invited him to the Harvard Community Sprint to highlight that the the Commons is a place where everyone is welcome, even a T-Rex!

Since then, Sprinty continues to join in the fun at Community Sprint events, and motivate Sprinters to keep up their amazing work. Be sure to grab a hug, a coveted photo, or a high five from Sprinty at an upcoming event.

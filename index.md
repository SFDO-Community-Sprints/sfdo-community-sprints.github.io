# Welcome to the Open Source Commons! 
The Commons program provides a platform for our community to address technology challenges in the Nonprofit and Education sectors through open source Salesforce innovation, but it’s so much more than that. Through Community Sprint events, like hack-a-thons, and other engagement spaces like Slack, our Nonprofit community defines challenges and builds open-source solutions to share with each other. For almost 20 years, Nonprofit Trailblazers just like you have contributed their Salesforce and professional skills to help solve common challenges, so that others could see more success with the power of Salesforce. Today, the Commons Community team continues that legacy, and drives impact through mentorship and learning opportunities.

## Get Involved at a Community Sprint
It's the 10th anniversary of Community Sprinting! What’s a [Community Sprint](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/docs/sprints/)? Originally starting in America in 2015, Community Sprints are the meet-ups (either in-person or virtually) portion of the Salesforce Commons Program, where we gather our engaged community of Customers, Partners, and Salesforce employees for 1-2 days of challenge discussion, solution brainstorming, and getting hands-on to build impactful Salesforce solutions to solve common day to day technology challenges that affect Nonprofit organizations and Schools. We do this by actively listening to each other, educating each other, and bringing our passion, Salesforce and professional experience, and technical know-how to projects that can be dreamed up, built by the community (you!), and then shared as open source solutions throughout the Salesforce ecosystem.

Sprinty the T-Rex is the official community mascot of the Commons. Sprinty (pronouns He/Him) represents inclusivity, comradery, and a can-do attitude. He has been a favorite member of the Sprinting community since 2016 when his dear friend Jace Bryan invited him to the Harvard Community Sprint to highlight that the the Commons is a place where everyone is welcome, even a T-Rex!

Since then, Sprinty continues to join in the fun at Community Sprint events, and motivate Sprinters to keep up their amazing work. Be sure to grab a hug, a coveted photo, or a high five from Sprinty at an upcoming event.
